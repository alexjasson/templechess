attacked, checking and pinned dont need to be in chessboard struct

I think it's better to have pieces as 1d array - YEAH BUT CHANGE LATER 2/2/24

if 1 check
pawn must capture or block - cant be pinned
knight must capture or block - cant be pinned
bishop must capture or block - cant be pinned
rook must capture or block - cant be pinned
queen must capture or block - cant be pinned

bitboard of empty pieces? YES!

if 0 check

have macros OUR(piece) and THEIR(piece) for pieces[12] array
