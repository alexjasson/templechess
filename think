We don't need to know if a move is a capture or not. Since
we update our board rep the same anyway.

e.g
BitBoard pieces[13] (including empty piece)
Piece squares[64]
BitBoard enpassant;
...

PieceType {Empty, Pawn, Knight, etc}
Color {Empty, White, Black}
MoveType {Empty, DoublePush, EnPassant, etc}
Fast macros to determine PieceType/Color of a Piece are easy here.
Square {Empty, a8, etc}

Make a boolean lookup table for queenside/kingside castling
